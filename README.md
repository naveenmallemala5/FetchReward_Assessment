## SQL Dialect Used

**SQL Dialect Used: Standard SQL**

The SQL queries provided in the documentation adhere to the Standard SQL dialect, which follows the ANSI SQL (American National Standards Institute SQL) standards. This dialect ensures compatibility and interoperability across various relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and others.

## Data Modeling

The data modeling section outlines the structured relational data model derived from the provided unstructured JSON data. It includes entity relationships, diagrams, and descriptions of entities and fields.

## SQL Queries

This section presents SQL queries for various business questions, such as identifying top brands, comparing rankings, analyzing spend and transactions, and more.

## Data Quality Assessment

Here, we discuss data quality issues observed in the dataset and provide SQL queries to identify incomplete data and inconsistencies across different tables.

## Communication with Stakeholders

This section includes communication strategies, such as email/slack messages, to address data quality concerns, optimization strategies, and collaboration with stakeholders.

## Resources Used

We list the tools, websites, and platforms utilized during the coding exercise, including JSON validators, SQL development environments, version control systems, and online communities.

## DDL Code

The Data Definition Language (DDL) code presents the schema definition used to create tables and establish relationships in the Fetch Rewards database.
